ILEE_CSK is a Python library that provides a platform for unguided and automated quantitative analysis of cytoskeletal images at high accuracy and free from bias, supporting both 2D and native 3D data structure. ILEE means Implicit Laplacian of Enhanced Edge, which is a local thresholding algorithm that detects and utilize the edge of cytoskeleton filaments as the local baseline for super-fine segmentation. Our robust algorithm can compute tens of indices reflecting diverse quantitative features of eukaryotic cytoskeleton for biological interpretation, which include (de/)polymerization, bundling, severing, branching, and local directionality.
